**📊 Retail Business Intelligence Dashboard**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project builds a complete business intelligence analysis system for retail transaction data.
It transforms raw transactional records into structured insights that support strategic decision-making.
The system automatically processes sales data and generates:

Revenue trends
Customer behavior insights
Product performance analysis
Geographic revenue distribution
Business KPIs
